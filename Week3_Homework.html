        Chocolate is a food product made from roasted and ground cacao pods,
        that is available as a liquid, solid or paste, on its own or as a
        flavoring agent in other foods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chocolate is one of the most popular food types and flavors in the
        world, and many foodstuffs involving chocolate exist, particularly
        desserts, including cakes, pudding, mousse, chocolate brownies, and
        chocolate chip cookies. Many candies are filled with or coated with
        sweetened chocolate. Chocolate bars, either made of solid chocolate or
        other ingredients coated in chocolate, are eaten as snacks. Gifts of
        chocolate molded into different shapes (such as eggs, hearts, coins) are
        traditional on certain Western holidays, including Christmas, Easter,
        Valentine's Day, and Hanukkah. Chocolate is also used in cold and hot
        beverages, such as chocolate milk and hot chocolate, and in some
        alcoholic drinks, such as creme de cacao.
